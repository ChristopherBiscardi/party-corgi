# Party Corgi Roles and How to Get Them

In the [Party Corgi Discord](https://discord.gg/partycorgi) we take advantage of Discord's rich support for roles to identify and highlight different community members and leaders. This includes the following list:

* adventure-club: *
* Emoji Curator
* Maintainer
* Moderator
* Nitro Booster
* Streamer
* Tummler

## Adventure Clubs

> Knowledge Adventure Clubs are the intersection of book clubs and Dungeons & Dragons.

[Knowledge adventure clubs](https://knowledgeadventure.club/) are used in Party Corgi for a variety of purposes including tabletop game campaigns, book clubs, and cohorts going through courses together. Anyone participating in an adventure club is given the role `adventure-club: <club>` where `<club>` is replaced with the specific club they participated in. This *can* be used to tag people if needed, but in general Party Corgi disables group mentions aside from the Moderator role.

## Emoji Curator

The `Emoji Curator` role is given to people who consistently create artwork so that they can add and maintain their own artwork in the emoji list. As a fully boosted server we have 250 emoji slots and while we haven't hit the limit yet we surely will one day.

## Maintainer

The `Maintainer` role is given to people who have consistently contributed to the [Party Corgi GitHub repos](https://github.com/partycorgi). This includes the [Discord bot](https://github.com/partycorgi/corgo-bot), [the website](https://github.com/partycorgi/partycorgi), and more.

## Moderator

`Moderator`s are responsible for dealing with any abuse reports. If there are duties left over, they also are (unofficially) typically handled by mods, although that is not explicitly part of the role and no mod is required to. The role is meant so that we have a dedicated group of people to handle Code of Conduct violations and can create a more horizontal set of roles that don't have to worry as much about kicking and banning if it needs to happen, but can still perform tummler or other duties in the community.

## Nitro Booster

People with the `Nitro Booster` role have it because they've [boosted the server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-). These people are directly financially contributing to the server and are how we have 1080p video, high-quality audio, 100mb upload limits, the vanity invite url ([discord.gg/partycorgi](https://discord.gg/partycorgi)) and more.

## Streamer

`Streamer` allows people to label themselves as being people who stream on Twitch, YouTube, or any other platform. This is an old role and will likely be updated to also recognize people who blog, create screencasts, and other forms of content.

* Tummler

A `Tummler` is responsible for the lifecycle of a particular channel. This is how we scale the community horizontally. They control the description of a channel and are responsible for motivating people to participate.

Here are a few posts about Tummlers from [Alex](https://dangerouslyawesome.com/2014/04/community-management-tummling-a-tale-of-two-mindsets/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/tummler) that cover the topic quite well.
